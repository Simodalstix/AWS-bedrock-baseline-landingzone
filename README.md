# Amazon Bedrock Baseline Architecture in AWS Landing Zone

A comprehensive, production-ready baseline architecture for Amazon Bedrock deployment within an AWS Landing Zone framework. This project demonstrates enterprise-grade AI governance, security, and operational excellence patterns.

## Architecture Overview

This baseline implements a multi-account AWS environment optimized for Amazon Bedrock workloads, following AWS Well-Architected principles and enterprise security best practices.

### Key Components

- **Multi-Account Structure**: Security, Logging, Shared Services, and Workload accounts
- **Bedrock Governance**: Model access controls, usage monitoring, and compliance
- **Security Baseline**: IAM policies, VPC design, and data protection
- **Operational Excellence**: Monitoring, logging, and cost optimization
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform modules for repeatable deployments

## Account Structure

```
├── Management Account (Organizations root)
├── Security Account (GuardDuty, Security Hub, Config)
├── Logging Account (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs)
├── Shared Services Account (Bedrock models, shared resources)
└── Workload Accounts (Application-specific Bedrock usage)
```

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites Setup**
2. **Deploy Core Infrastructure**
3. **Configure Bedrock Baseline**
4. **Deploy Sample Workload**
